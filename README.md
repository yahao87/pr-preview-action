# Deploy PR Preview action

[GitHub Action](https://github.com/features/actions) that deploys previews
of pull requests to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Works on any
repository with a GitHub Pages site.

Features:

- Creates and deploys previews of pull requests to your GitHub Pages site
- Leaves a comment on the pull request with a link to the preview so that
  you and your team can collaborate on new features faster
- Updates the deployment and the comment whenever new commits are pushed to
  the pull request
- Cleans up after itself &mdash; removes deployed previews when the pull
  request is closed
- Can be configured to override any of these behaviours

Preview URLs look like this:
`https://[owner].github.io/[repo]/pr-preview/pr-[number]/`

This Action does not currently support deploying previews for PRs from forks,
but will do so in [the upcoming
v2](https://github.com/rossjrw/pr-preview-action/pull/6).

## Usage

A [GitHub Actions
workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions) is
required to use this Action.

All the workflow needs to do first is checkout the repository and build the
Pages site.

First, ensure that your repository is configured to have its GitHub Pages
site deployed from a branch, by setting the source for the deployment under
**Settings** > **Pages** of your repository to **Deploy from branch**:

</p>

</p>

The `gh-pages` branch is used for GitHub Pages deployments by convention,
and will be used in examples here as well.

If your GitHub pages site is deployed from the `gh-pages` branch, built
with e.g. an `npm` script to the `./build/` dir, and you're happy with the
default settings, usage is very simple:

```yml
# .github/workflows/preview.yml
name: Deploy PR previews

on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - reopened
      - synchronize
      - closed

concurrency: preview-${{ github.ref }}

jobs:
  deploy-preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install and Build
        if: github.event.action != 'closed' # You might want to skip the build if the PR has been closed
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run build

      - name: Deploy preview
        uses: rossjrw/pr-preview-action@v1
        with:
          source-dir: ./build/
```

### Important things to be aware of

#### Run only when files are changed

Consider limiting this workflow to run [only when relevant files are
edited](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#onpushpull_requestpull_request_targetpathspaths-ignore)
to avoid deploying previews unnecessarily.

#### Run on all appropriate pull request events

Be sure to [pick the right event
types](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#pull_request)
for the `pull_request` event. It only comes with `opened`, `reopened`, and
`synchronize` by default &mdash; but this Action assumes by default that
the preview should be removed during the `closed` event, which it only sees
if you explicitly add it to the workflow.

#### Grant Actions permission to read and write to the repository

This must be changed in the repository settings by selecting "Read and
write permissions" at **Settings** > **Actions** > **General** >
**Workflow permissions**. Otherwise, the Action won't be able to make any
changes to your deployment branch.

#### Set a concurrency group

I highly recommend [setting a concurrency
group](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-concurrency)
scoped to each PR using `github.ref` as above, which should prevent the
preview and comment from desynchronising if you are e.g. committing very
frequently.

#### Ensure your main deployment is compatible

If you are using GitHub Actions to deploy your GitHub Pages sites
(typically on push to the main branch), there are some actions you should
take to avoid the PR preview overwriting the main deployment, or
vice-versa.

1. **Prevent your main deployment from deleting previews**

   If your root directory on the GitHub Pages deployment branch (or `docs/`
   on the main branch) is generated automatically (e.g. on pushes to the
   main branch, with a tool such as Webpack), you will need to configure it
   not to remove the umbrella directory (`pr-preview/` by default, see
   configuration below).

   For example, if you are using
   [JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action)
   to deploy your build, you can implement this using its `clean-exclude`
   parameter:

   ```yml
   # .github/workflows/build-deploy-pages-site.yml
   steps:
     ...
     - uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
       ...
       with:
         clean-exclude: pr-preview/
         ...
   ```

   If you don't do this, your main deployment may delete all of your
   currently-existing PR previews.

2. **Don't force-push your main deployment**

   Force-pushing your main deployment will cause it to overwrite any and
   all files in the deployment location. This will destroy any ongoing
   preview deployments. Instead, consider adjusting your deployment
   workflow to rebase or merge your main deployment onto the deployment
   branch such that it respects other ongoing deployments.

   For example, if you are using
   [JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action)
   to deploy your build, be aware that at the time of writing (v4.3.0) it
   force-pushes new deployments by default. You can disable this by setting
   its `force` parameter to `false`, which will prompt it to rebase new
   deployments instead of force-pushing them:

   ```yml
   # .github/workflows/build-deploy-pages-site.yml
   steps:
     ...
     - uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
       ...
       with:
         force: false
         ...
   ```

   This feature was introduced in v4.3.0 of the above Action.

####

## Configuration

The following configuration settings are provided, which can be passed to
the `with` parameter.

- `source-dir`: Directory containing files to deploy.

  E.g. if your project builds to `./dist/` you would put `./dist/` (or just
  `dist`) here. For the root directory of your project, put `.` here.

  Equivalent to
  [JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action)
  'folder' setting.

  Will be ignored when removing a preview.

  Default: `.`

- `preview-branch`: Branch on which the previews will be deployed. This
  should be the same branch that your GitHub Pages site is deployed from.

  Default: `gh-pages`

- `umbrella-dir`: Name of the directory containing all previews. All
  previews will be created inside this directory.

  The umbrella directory is used to namespace previews from your main
  branch's deployment on GitHub Pages.

  Set to `.` to place preview directories into the root directory, but be
  aware that this may cause your main branch's deployment to interfere with
  your preview deployments (and vice-versa!)

  Default: `pr-preview`

- `pr-number`: 커스텀한 상황에서 PR번호를 주입하여 타겟 디렉토리를 맞추기 위함

- `custom-url`: Base URL to use when providing a link to the preview site.

  Default: Will attempt to calculate the repository's GitHub Pages URL
  (e.g. "rossjrw.github.io").

- `deploy-repository`: The repository to deploy the preview to.

  If this value is changed from the default, the `token` parameter must also
  be set (see below).

  Default: The current repository that the pull request was made in.

- `token`: The token to use for the preview deployment. The default value is
  fine for deployments to the current repository, but if you want to deploy
  the preview to a different repository (see `deploy-repository` above), you
  will need to create a [Personal Access
  Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token)
  with permission to access it, and [store it as a
  secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions)
  in your repository. E.g. you might name that secret 'PREVIEW_TOKEN' and
  use it with `token: ${{ secrets.PREVIEW_TOKEN }}`.

  Default: `${{ github.token }}`, which gives the action permission to
  deploy to the current repository.

- **(Advanced)** `action`: Determines what this action will do when it is
  executed. Supported values: `deploy`, `remove`, `none`, `auto`.

  - `deploy`: will attempt to deploy the preview and overwrite any
    existing preview in that location.
  - `remove`: will attempt to remove the preview in that location.
  - `auto`: the action will try to determine whether to deploy or remove
    the preview based on [the emitted
    event](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/webhooks-and-events/webhooks/webhook-events-and-payloads#pull_request).
    It will deploy the preview on `pull_request.types.opened`, `.reopened`
    and `.synchronize` events; and remove it on `pull_request.types.closed`
    events. It will not do anything for all other events, even if you
    explicitly specify that the workflow should run on them.
  - `none` and all other values: the action will not do anything.

  Default value: `auto`

## Outputs

- `deployment-url`: the URL at which the preview has been deployed.

## Examples

### Full example

Full example with all default values added:

```yml
# .github/workflows/preview.yml
name: Deploy PR previews
concurrency: preview-${{ github.ref }}
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - reopened
      - synchronize
      - closed
jobs:
  deploy-preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm i && npm run build
        if: github.event.action != 'closed'
      - uses: rossjrw/pr-preview-action@v1
        with:
          source-dir: .
          preview-branch: gh-pages
          umbrella-dir: pr-preview
          action: auto
```

...and an accompanying main deployment workflow:

```yml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
name: Deploy PR previews
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  deploy-preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm i && npm run build
      - uses: JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action@v4
        with:
          folder: .
          branch: gh-pages
          clean-exclude: pr-preview
          force: false
```

### Deployment from `docs/`

If your Pages site is built to `build/` and deployed from the `docs/`
directory on the `main` branch:

```yml
# .github/workflows/preview.yml
steps:
  ...
  - uses: rossjrw/pr-preview-action@v1
    with:
      source-dir: build
      preview-branch: main
      umbrella-dir: docs/pr-preview
```

You should definitely limit this workflow to run only on changes to
directories other than `docs/`, otherwise this workflow will call itself recursively.

### Only remove previews for unmerged PRs

Information from the context and conditionals can be used to make more
complex decisions about what to do with previews; for example, removing
only those associated with _unmerged_ PRs when they are closed:

```yml
# .github/workflows/preview.yml
steps:
  ...
  - uses: rossjrw/pr-preview-action@v1
    if: contains(['opened', 'reopened', 'synchronize'], github.event.action)
    with:
      source-dir: ./build/
      action: deploy
  - uses: rossjrw/pr-preview-action@v1
    if: github.event.action == "closed" && !github.event.pull_request.merged
    with:
      source-dir: ./build/
      action: remove
```

### Permanent previews

If you want to keep PR previews around forever, even after the associated
PR has been closed, you don't want the cleanup behaviour of `auto` &mdash;
call `deploy` and never call `remove`:

```yml
# .github/workflows/everlasting-preview.yml
name: Deploy everlasting PR preview
concurrency: preview-${{ github.ref }}
on:
  pull_request:
    types:
      - opened
      - synchronize
jobs:
  deploy-preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - run: npm i && npm run build
      - uses: rossjrw/pr-preview-action@v1
        with:
          source-dir: ./build/
          action: deploy
```
